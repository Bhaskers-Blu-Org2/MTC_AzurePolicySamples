# Lab 3 â€“ Customizing Azure Policy
WELCOME! Here are some tips-and-tricks you can use while in the workshop
1.	Open a Notepad text document and save it. This is where you can copy-and-paste variables, connection string, credentials vs. having to refer to another web page for those values
2.	Open a browser session to have as your Azure portal and Azure Cloud Shell
3.	Have a different browser session open to the GitHub repo with all the lab instructions

## Lab Goals
Create custom policies and assign them to a policy set.

### Learning Objectives
- Objective 1

## Requirements
- Requirement 1

### Clone this GitHub Repository
If you haven't cloned the repository already, please follow these instructions.

There are several files you will use from this repository, so to ease access you will clone the repository to your local machine.  In this workshop, you will not be creating your own GitHub repository from the workshop cloned repository; you can do that work later if desired.
1.	Go to https://aka.ms/mtcazurepolicysamples
2.	Select `Clone or download` from the left side
3.	You can either download the .ZIP file and extract locally or you can copy the link or clone the repository on the command line.  If you are using GitHub Desktop, you can clone it by selecting `Open in Desktop`
4.	To clone using the command line, open a CMD shell and change directory to where you want the repository cloned

`git clone <paste in the copied repository link from the above step>`
